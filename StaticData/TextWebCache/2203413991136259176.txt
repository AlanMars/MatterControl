                    "Content": "<h3><strong>PULSE ENCLOSURE KIT</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Having trouble maintaining a consistent, warm temperature around your <a title=\"Pulse 3D Printers\" href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/Pulse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulse</a>? Check out our solution&mdash;the Pulse Enclosure Kit. Designed to regulate temperature and reduce warping that can occur during printing, this enclosure kit makes successful printing even easier to achieve. In addition to maintaining optimal temperatures, the enclosure protects curious fingers (and paws) from touching hot, moving printer parts as well as your prints. While this is intended to be used with any model of the Pulse 3D printer, this enclosure kit will regulate temperature for any 3D printer of the same size or smaller.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>SUCCESSFUL PRINTING MADE EASY</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Cold temperatures warping your prints are now a thing of the past with the Pulse Enclosure Kit! Maintaining a specific, steady temperature in an entire room can be difficult, but controlling it through a restricted enclosure is much easier. That's where our enclosure kit comes in. With thick, solid panels blocking airflow from all sides, unwanted cold air won't be able to cause excessive cooling that often leads to warping. Thanks to the limited airflow within the enclosure, the heat given off the hotend extruder and heated bed stays trapped in the chamber which keeps temperature consistently and optimally warm for your prints and heated components. Added bonus: the trapped heat during a print session also does well to keep your spool of filament dry, making the enclosure super beneficial when printing with materials that tend to absorb moisture such as <a title=\"PETG\" href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/PRO%20Series%20PETG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PETG</a>, <a title=\"NylonX\" href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/NylonX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NylonX</a>, <a title=\"NylonG\" href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/nylong\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NylonG</a>, and more. Successful printing is made easy with the Pulse Enclosure Kit</p>\r\n<h3><strong>SAFETY AND PROTECTION</strong></h3>\r\n<p>On top of protecting the success of your prints, the Pulse Enclosure Kit also protects curious kids and pets from easily touching hot parts of your 3D printer. If your printer is often left unattended where curious fingers (or paws) can access it, this enclosure provides the bonus barrier needed to prevent accidentally touching hot components when the printer is operational out in the open. Add an extra safety measurement to your 3D printer with our Pulse Enclosure Kit.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>DESIGNED WITH PULSE IN MIND</strong></h3>\r\n<p>No other enclosure on the market will work better for the Pulse than this enclosure kit. Every door, knockout and dimension of this enclosure is engineered around the Pulse's specific design for smooth user experience. When you purchase the Pulse Enclosure Kit, you're getting an enclosed build chamber that maintains optimal temperature while also having strategically placed access points to the Pulse for common procedures such as changing spools, adjusting the filament extruder, switching on/off your printer, and more. Keep your Pulse well enclosed without compromising accessibility using our Pulse Enclosure Kit.</p>",
